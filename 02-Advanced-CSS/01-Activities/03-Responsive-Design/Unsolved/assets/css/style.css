What is the flex-wrap property? 
TODO: 
  The flex-wrap property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module.

  It defines whether the flex items are forced in a single line or can be flowed into multiple lines. 
  If set to multiple lines, it also defines the cross-axis which determines the direction new lines are stacked in.
  
  - The flex-wrap property accepts 3 different values:

    * nowrap (default): single-line which may cause the container to overflow
    * wrap: multi-lines, direction is defined by flex-direction
    * wrap-reverse: multi-lines, opposite to direction defined by flex-direction

What is the flex property a shorthand property for?
What is it doing here? 
TODO: 
 - What is the flex property a shorthand property for? 
    The flex shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.
 - What is it doing here? 
    + It is used to set the length of flexible items. 
    + The flex property is much responsive and mobile-friendly. 
    + It is easy to position child elements and the main container. 
    + The margin doesnâ€™t collapse with the content margins.
    + The order of any element can be easily changed without editing the HTML section.
      - This is a shorthand property that sets flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
